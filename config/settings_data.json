Good bacteria live in our digestive tract and are necessary for our bodies to function properly.

Probiotics need to be living and be the same as or similar to the microorganisms that naturally live in our body to be effective.","faq_second_title":"Why should I take probiotics?","faq_second_content":"Taking daily probiotics supports the health of our digestive tract. This is important because a healthy digestive tract is key to maintaining overall health, preventing disease and other health problems, and recovering from illness. Probiotics do this by creating a healthy habitat of microflora in your gut—the microscopic mix of bacteria, algae and fungi. Taking daily probiotics ensures we have a healthy mix of gut bacteria so our bodies function properly.","faq_third_title":"What’s the difference between a probiotic supplement versus probiotic foods?","faq_third_content":"Probiotics, to be effective in humans, must be living cultures derived from mammals.

This is because the antibiotics work to wipe out all microorganisms in our gut, both good and bad. Taking probiotics during this time will help repopulate the good bacteria we need during this time to facilitate digestion, immunity and other health benefits of good bacteria. It will not hurt us to rebuild the good bacteria in our gut while we are eliminating the bad bacteria in our gut, and it will help our digestive tract continue to function properly.

Innovia&trade; Nectar probiotics come in a unique micro-shot system that separates the powder probiotic from the plant extract and vitamin-fortified liquid, until the moment the packaging seal is broken and the two are combined. This system keeps the probiotic fresh, dry and stable. Other probiotic products degrade faster than Innovia&trade; Nectar.

Innovia&trade; Nectar is needed daily because the bacteria in our gut is constantly changing, due to the complex homeostasis of our bodies which are affected by the food we eat and the lifestyle we lead. This means we must tend to the delicate balance of the microflora in our gut, similar to how we might tend to a garden, keeping healthy plants growing while preventing an overgrowth of weeds. While it does not matter what time of day Innovia&trade; Nectar is taken, many Italians enjoy it in the early morning or at night prior to sleep.

It is essential to seek a &lsquo;strain specific&rsquo; probiotic that has been proven, in human health studies, to have a beneficial effect at a specific dose. Consumers should look not only for the genus and species (for example <i>Lactobacillus paracasei<\/i>), but also the strain ID number (such as CNCM I-1572) to ensure that the probiotic they are using has been fully characterized and purified, as well as clinically tested in human studies. Innovia&trade; Nectar micro-shot products contain only gold-standard, stable and viable strains, which have been selected for their scientifically proven health benefits.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["1510217636887","1510217649835","1510217684971","1510217703684","1510222553591","1510217720179","1510217735842","1510217761588","1510217817747","1510217838888","1510217870942","1510217908214"],"settings":{"faq_title":"Frequently Asked Questions","faq_subtitle":"Find answers to product and policy questions.
